                <h2 id="whatSpot">What is Spotter?</h2>
                    <p>Spotter is a web application designed to help find missing people and spread awareness of those who are missing.</p>
                <h2 id="howSpot">How does Spotter work?</h2>
                    <p>Spotter searches Twitter for the <strong>#SpotMissingPerson</strong> hashtag and the appropriate Tweets, then pins the missing people on a map of their last seen locations. This way, people can keep track of missing people all around the country and their last seen locations. Our "Spotters" are people who have signed up for live text-updates of missing people in their area. If a person is found or spotted, the spotter must call 911 (you don't need to be signed up to do this).</p>
            
            <h2 id="tweetLayout">How do I report a missing person?</h2>
                <p>A missing person must be reported following this tweet template, with the hashtag <strong>#SpotMissing</strong> </p>
            <p>Name: <br>
            Details: </p>
            
            <p><strong>Warning: Please ensure you have Geolocation or Location Services enabled on your device before tweeting so we are able to notify people in your area.</strong></p>
            
            <h2 id="textUpdate">How do text updates work?</h2>
                <p>Spotters who have signed up for text updates will be notified whenever someone in their area goes missing. To cancel text updates, text "cancel" to <strong>+12897960748</strong>.</p>
            
            <h2 id="foundPerson">How do I report when someone has been found?</h2>
             <p>After the person has been found, a family member or friend can then submit a "Found Request Form" which we will then follow up on and confirm, and remove their name from the missing list and send out an update that they have been found.</p>
            
            <h2 id="infoUpdate">How is this information updated?</h2>
            <p>All missing people are automatically removed after 30 days, if they are still missing, another missing request must be made in the form of a Tweet, as before.</p>
